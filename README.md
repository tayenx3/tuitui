# tuitui 🐧

Build terminal interfaces faster. A batteries-included TUI framework for Rust 
with low boilerplate and a rich component ecosystem.

## Why tuitui?

- **Friendly API** - Great error messages and gentle learning curve
- **Low Boilerplate** - Focus on your app, not framework code
- **Batteries Included** - Forms, tables, lists, and more built-in
- **Composable** - Easy to build and share custom components
- **Predictable** - Follows Rust conventions, no hidden magic

## Quick Start

```rust
use tuitui::prelude::*;

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    /* we'll add stuff here once we lock in on the API */
}
```
